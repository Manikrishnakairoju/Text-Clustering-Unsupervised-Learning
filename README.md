NLP_Text Clustering â€“ Unsupervised Learning

TASKS:


Dataset Selection
Select a dataset that aligns with your interests and objectives for the text analysis. Consider the following criteria:
Ensure the dataset is relevant to your area of study or interest
Choose a dataset that is readily accessible and publicly available, preferably in a format suitable for analysis (such as CSV or Excel).
Consider the size of the dataset and whether it is manageable for your analysis purposes.
Assess the quality of the dataset in terms of completeness, accuracy and reliability.

Data Collection
Collect a text dataset suitable for clustering and topic modelling. This could be news articles, academic papers, social media posts, etc.
Provide a brief description of the dataset, including its source, size and any relevant characteristics.

Text Pre-Processing
Perform the following preprocessing steps on the collected text data:
Convert text to lowercase.
Remove punctuation.
Perform tokenization.
Remove stop words.
Perform text normalization (stemming or lemmatization).


Data Exploration
Explore to understand the distribution and characteristics of the text data.
Visualize the data using appropriate charts (such as word clouds or frequency distributions).
Provide insights based on the data exploration.

Text Vectorization
Convert the pre-processed text data into numerical representations using techniques such as these:
Bag-of-words (BoW)
Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)
Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)

Text Clustering
Apply clustering algorithms to the vectorized text data. Use at least two different algorithms, such as these:
K-Means clustering 
Hierarchical clustering 
Any another clustering algorithm 
Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques such as the elbow method or silhouette score.
Visualize and analyze the clustering results.

Topic Modeling
Apply topic modeling techniques to discover hidden topics within the text data. Use at least two different methods, such as these:
Latent dirichlet allocation (LDA)
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) 
Any another topic modeling technique
Interpret the discovered topics and provide meaningful labels for each topic.
Visualize the top words in each topic and analyze the results.

Model Comparison and Analysis
Compare the results of the different clustering algorithms and topic modeling techniques.
Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
Discuss any challenges faced during the implementation and how they were addressed.
